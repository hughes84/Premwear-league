## UX

In designing this website, simplicity was a key focus. Complicating the layout of an e-commerce platform can detract from the user experience, which is something I actively sought to avoid.

Throughout the site, I've maintained a straightforward design approach. Users can conveniently track their basket's total as they browse and add items. Unlike platforms that conceal this information until checkout, my approach fosters trust and helps users manage their spending effectively.

Navigation is intuitive, facilitated by a user-friendly main menu that allows easy exploration of all sportswear product categories. This site is crafted to offer seamless access to a wide range of products without overwhelming users with complex menus or structures.

In essence, the website prioritizes simplicity and transparency, aiming to provide users with a positive and stress-free browsing experience from start to finish.
